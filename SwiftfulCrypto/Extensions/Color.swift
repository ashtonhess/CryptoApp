//extension created to extend Color class.
//Color class already exists in source code, so this is retractive modeling, extending type Color.
//DOCS:
//Extensions add new functionality to an existing class, structure, enumeration, or protocol type. This includes the ability to extend types for which you donâ€™t have access to the original source code (known as retroactive modeling)
extension Color {
    
    static let theme = ColorTheme()
    
}

//These colors are also adaptive to light and dark mode. set in assets.
//Can easily add more colors to this theme.
//Can easily make another color theme and switch between them. Just copy this color theme again and rename, also setting new colors for new themes.

struct ColorTheme{
    let accent = Color("AccentColor")
    let background = Color("BackgroundColor")
    let green = Color("GreenColor")
    let red = Color("RedColor")
